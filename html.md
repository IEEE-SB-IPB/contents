# What is HTML?

HTML stands for hypertext markup language which is a language that powers the web. Everything you see on a website is basically structures of HTML.

You can simply think of it as a document, just like your regular word files!

![HTML Example](https://github.com/IEEE-SB-IPB/contents/assets/65883882/0a408b1b-1868-4d5a-a717-3b7d6ee44435)

An HTML page consists of an `<html>` tag to tell the browser that it's an HTML file, a `<head>` that contains metadata of the page, and a `<body>` tag.

If you're just starting, don't worry about the boilerplate! All you need to think about is anything inside the `<body>` tag. Because anything you see on the page will be inside the body tag.

In most text editor, the shortcut to build the boilerplate is `!` and then press tab. But different editor may vary. You can learn more about HTML on **w3schools.com/html**

"But why it's so plain?" That's when CSS comes in! We'll talk a bit about it on the next post. Stay tune!
