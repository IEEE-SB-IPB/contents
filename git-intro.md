# Git Tiktok Awareness

How would you collaborate on a group assignment? Yes, it's Git, or Github if you name it.

But do you know what it is exactly?

Git is simply a version control system. You change something, and then you track the version or "commit" the change that you've made.

The collaborating things is done on a site called Github.

> There's plenty other alternative. Github is just one of them.

After you track your change or "commit", you would upload the change to the cloud or "push". And your teammate will download your change to their machine or "pull". And that's it! The flow is just like that on repeat.

And lastly, you won't do a coding assignment by directly uploading the files to Github.

Thank you very much and see ya later.
