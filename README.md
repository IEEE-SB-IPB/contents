# Contents of IEEE SB IPB 🌐

> This is a repository to store contents of IEEE SB IPB. Read the guide below before writing any. Be sure that you understand and fulfill the guide provided. This repo is very open to anyone especially officer/member of IEEE SB IPB.

## Guide

- Every line break (paragraph) is a different slide for Instagram carousel. Except for images, it will be in the same slide as the text above it.
- Don't write too much text in a single paragraph/slide. Two or three sentences is okay.
- Easily drop image by copying it to clipboard (screen snip) and paste it directly on the GitHub text editor. It will automatically upload the pic.
- Code blocks must be in monospace font in final design render.

## Happy writing! :D
